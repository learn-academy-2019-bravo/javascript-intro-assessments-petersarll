a method is a function that is a property of an object

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
charAt(), charCodeAt(), includes(), replace(), search(), split(), slice(), toLowerCase(), toString(),  

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
A mutator is an operator that can manipulate the value of an array whereas an accessor will only receive the value you are looking for. If you need to manipulate & change the value of an array (for instance add 2 to 3) you could use the mutator method. if you just needed to receive the value without changing the value, then you would use the accessor.  

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console log is a function to specifically print information to the console. This is great when trying to see mistakes in your code. Return changes the value if a call was made. once the function has stopped executing, it will return the unspecified value. it will not execute code on your console.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
Repetition. being able to do the same thing over and over again really helps. And reminding us that google is your friend. being reminded that you wont be able to remember everything and that searching is ok. Being able to search and use it in your code is valuable.
